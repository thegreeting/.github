# üîó The Greeting Project: Web3√óBLE Trustless Attendance Verification

A zero-knowledge oracle protocol that bridges real-world experiences with blockchain verification through Bluetooth Low Energy proximity detection. Building foundational infrastructure for objective, tamper-resistant proof of attendance without centralized authorities.

## üéØ The Problem We Solve

Current event attendance systems like POAP depend on centralized issuers who can mint tokens for anyone, making them unreliable as actual participation proof. There is no decentralized algorithm to objectively prove **"who was actually there."**

**Our Solution:** Cryptographic proof of physical presence through peer-to-peer BLE proximity detection, anchored to blockchain for tamper-resistant verification.

## üîß Core Technology

### Trustless Verification Protocol

- **BLE Proximity Detection:** Leverages proven Bluetooth Low Energy technology inspired by COVID contact tracing
- **Cryptographic Proof Generation:** Automatic recording of device interactions creates tamper-resistant attendance evidence
- **Blockchain Anchoring:** Smart contracts store aggregated interaction data ensuring verifiable, objective proof

### Privacy-Preserving Design

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Prove attendance while protecting personal data through selective disclosure
- **W3C Verifiable Credentials:** Generate standard VCs from verified attendance, giving users full control
- **Decentralized Architecture:** No central authority can manipulate or deny legitimate participation records

## üöÄ Galleon Protocol Vision

### Modular Oracle System

Beyond attendance verification, our extensible architecture supports diverse real-world data types:

- **Skills & Contributions:** Verify real-world achievements and demonstrations
- **Location-Based Experiences:** Proof of geographical activities and movements
- **Time-Based Commitments:** Evidence of sustained participation and engagement

### Web3 Ecosystem Impact

- **Enhanced Sybil Resistance:** Physical presence proof as powerful authenticity signal
- **DAO Governance Improvement:** Reliable participant identification for fairer governance
- **Reputation Systems Foundation:** Bridge physical and digital identities for next-generation trust

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Proof of Attendance Oracle

Currently developing the foundational Proof of Attendance Oracle Data Track:

- Mobile application/SDK for BLE peer-to-peer interaction logging
- Smart contracts for event registration and verification
- VC issuance functionality from proven on-chain attendance records

### Technical Validation Focus

- **Algorithm Optimization:** BLE proximity detection accuracy with ~50 participants
- **Security Countermeasures:** Spoofing detection and fake device exclusion
- **Scalability Testing:** Performance validation at mid-scale events
- **Privacy Integration:** Zero-knowledge proof implementation for selective disclosure

## üåç Target Applications

### Initial Use Cases

- **International Hackathons:** ETHGlobal and similar events requiring objective participation proof
- **Technical Conferences:** Developer meetups, blockchain conferences, Web3 community gatherings
- **DAO Governance:** Enhanced member verification for voting and participation rights

### Long-term Vision

- **Professional Networking:** Verifiable industry event participation for career validation
- **Educational Credentials:** Proof of workshop attendance, course completion
- **Community Engagement:** Local event participation, volunteer activity verification

## üî¨ Public Good Commitment

### Open Source Infrastructure

- **Permissive Licensing:** All core components released under MIT/Apache 2.0
- **Community-Driven Development:** Transparent development process with public feedback
- **Interoperability Focus:** W3C standards compliance for broad ecosystem compatibility

### Foundational Protocol Strategy

Following the email protocol model - establish reliable public infrastructure first, enable diverse applications second. No proprietary tokens or centralized control mechanisms.

## üîÆ Technical Roadmap

### Current Development (2025-2026)

- **Core Protocol Implementation:** BLE interaction algorithms and blockchain anchoring
- **Security Research:** Advanced cryptographic proof methods and privacy enhancement
- **Real-world Validation:** Progressive testing from small meetups to international conferences

### Future Extensions

- **Multi-Modal Verification:** Combination with other real-world data sources
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **Developer Ecosystem:** SDKs, APIs, and integration tools for third-party applications
